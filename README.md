# ListingAssignment

1. I have created two screens in this project - one for a phone, one for a tablet. On the tablet, the details and title are on the same screen, but on the phone, the details have a separate screen.

2. I have also added variants to this project. One is the project's own variant, and then I created flavors for SimpsonsViewer and WireViewer, both available on iOS and Android. I used React Native config to check the environment and validate the APIs.

3. For the SimpsonsViewer, the API endpoint is: "https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=simpsons+characters&format=json". This URL will be used.

4. For the WireViewer and the project's own target, the API endpoint is: "https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=the+wire+characters&format=json". This URL will be used. I have placed all these in the ApiService file.

5. I have also considered responsiveness, focusing on both landscape and portrait orientations.

6. Additionally, I have added search functionality.
